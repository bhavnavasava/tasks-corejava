task 13) why ArrayList ? how it works internally ?  what if it overflow or it is possible?
	what is the max size of ArrayList?

 Arraylist?

-->The most obvious reason is that an ArrayList in Java is resizable. Unlike standard arrays, an ArrayList grows upon the addition of new elements.
	 An array is fixed in size, and once it is full, you cannot add more items to it.

-->what is the max size of ArrayList?
	When you initialize an ArrayList, an array of size 10 (default capacity) is created and an element added to the ArrayList is actually added to this array. 
	10 is the default size and it can be passed as a parameter while initializing the ArrayList.

-->how it works internally ? what if it overflow or it is possible?
	When adding a new element, if the array is full, then a new array of 50% more the initial size is created and the last array is copied to this new array 
	so that now there are empty spaces for the new element to be added.

	Since the underlying data-structure used is an array, it is fairly easy to add a new element to the ArrayList as it is added to the end of the list. 
	When an element is to be added anywhere else, say the beginning, then all the elements shall have to move one position to the right to
	create an empty space at the beginning for the new element to be added. This process is time-consuming (linear-time).
  	But the Advantage of ArrayList is that retrieving an element at any position is very fast (constant-time), 
  	as underlying it is simply using an array of objects.
